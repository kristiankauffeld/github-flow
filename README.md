# The Github Flow

Github flow is a so-called "branching strategy", and it provides a way of standardizing the workflow in a development team that uses Github as their primary version control platform. The key advantage of Github Flow, compared to other branching strategies, is its simplicity and ease of use. 

The Github Flow model consists of the following steps:

### 1. Create a branch:
- When starting a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the master branch. You will (almost always) want to make it from the master branch.
- When working on a feature or fix, use short-lived branches as much as possible. The age of the branch should not be longer than one week.
- If you are working on a big feature, try to split it into different parts. Once you start with a part, create a new branch for it and merge it into the main branch before starting with the next part.

### 2. Add commits:

### 3. Open a pull request
- When you are ready to share your changes, open a pull request from your branch to the master branch. This allows other members of your team to review and provide feedback on your changes.
- When submitting a pull-request (PR), please try to limit the amount of code between 10-100 lines. This makes it easier for the reviewer to catch bugs and leave useful feedback.

### 4. Review and discuss

### 5. Merge the changes

### 6. Deploy the changes
